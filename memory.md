# Memory

Memory is a significant idea inspired by [neuroscience](/background/neuroscience/), from which we know that there are different types of memory systems in the brain, such as short-term working memory and episodic memory. Traditionally neural networks don't have much memory and adding memory to them hasn't yet shown widespread evidence of promise. Consequently, this is a relatively neglected area in the science towards AGI.

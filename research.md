# Research

This is where the [Home](http://realai.org) section of this site meets the [About](http://realai.org/about/) section. We will document our own results that are not yet covered by existing literature. Our research is aimed at building an AGI system and will be guided by knowledge-based [big-picture understanding](http://realai.org/background/) of intelligence, regardless of its near-term publication potential. We expect that many of our results won't be publishable by today's academic standard, because "the bar is quite high for a general system to be able to beat specialized systems" whose performance can be easily honed for a given task ([Vincent, 2017](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/19/15998610/ai-neuroscience-machine-learning-deepmind-demis-hassabis-interview)). When determining where to allocate resources most productively, if a non-publishable result shows signs of promise consistent with our understanding of intelligence, even if it doesn't attain state-of-the-art performance, we're likely to redouble engineering efforts geared to making it work. This strategy is also advocated in [Hassabis et al. (2017)](http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30509-3).

## System Requirements

As of September 2017, our concept of an AGI system is a [chatbot](http://realai.org/chatbot/) capable of common sense [reasoning](http://realai.org/reasoning/) with the abilities to communicate with its users in [natural language](http://realai.org/natural-language-processing/) and to access the Internet. Such a system is referred to as an [oracle](http://realai.org/safety/oracle-ai/) in the field of [AI safety](http://realai.org/safety/). As a small research company constrained by human and financial resources, we will focus on the most essential aspects of general intelligence. For example, we're unlikely to work on a shiny graphical user interface before our text-based chatbot can talk sensibly, let alone building robots with highly realistic appearances. We design our system with the balance in mind to support flexible working conditions without losing the ability to scale when the demand of large computational complexity arises. We rely on open-source libraries and commoditized IT systems as much as possible.

* Hardware: [Windows](http://realai.org/course/windows/)-based PC, laptop, or [(Google) cloud](http://realai.org/course/google-cloud-platform/) computers
* Operating System: [Ubuntu](http://realai.org/course/ubuntu/)
* Programming Language: [Python 3](http://realai.org/course/python/) (managed by [Conda](http://realai.org/course/conda/))
* Development Environment: [Jupyter](http://realai.org/course/jupyter/), tmux and [vim](http://realai.org/course/vim/)
* Documentation: realai.org [viewed on the web](http://realai.org/), a Jekyll site on [GitHub](http://realai.org/course/github/)
* Source: realai.org [viewed on GitHub](https://github.com/real-ai/realai.org)
* Deep Learning Library: PyTorch

This setup is subject to change over time, but it is likely a satisfactory package that allows our contributors to have a largely consistent development experience across a wide range of working conditions.
